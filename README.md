Python Port Scanner
Objective

The Python Port Scanner project was developed to explore network security by identifying open ports and running services on a target system. The goal was to understand network reconnaissance, learn how services can be discovered, and gain hands-on experience with Python scripting, multithreading, and cybersecurity fundamentals in a controlled Kali Linux environment.

Skills Learned

Practical experience with network scanning and port enumeration

Understanding of common services and protocols running on open ports

Experience in multithreading for efficient scanning

Python scripting for developing security tools

Understanding the role of reconnaissance in penetration testing workflows

Packages Used

socket – for network communication and port checking

threading – for concurrent scanning to improve speed

sys – for command-line argument handling

time – for scan timing and delays

Steps

Below are the key steps taken in using the Python Port Scanner:

1. Target Selection

A target IP or hostname was selected within a controlled Kali Linux VM environment to safely test the scanner.

2. Port Scanning

The Python script used socket programming and multithreading to scan a range of ports and identify which ones were open.

3. Service Detection

After identifying open ports, the scanner attempted to detect common services running on those ports (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP).

This screenshot demonstrates how the scanner maps ports to services.

4. Analysis and Validation

Scan results were compared with Nmap to validate accuracy and learn about port behavior.

5. Reporting

Finally, all scan results were summarized in a readable report, highlighting open ports, detected services, and potential security considerations.
