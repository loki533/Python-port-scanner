# Python Port Scanner

## **Objective**
The **Python Port Scanner** project was developed to explore network security by identifying open ports and running services on a target system. The goal was to understand **network reconnaissance**, learn how services can be discovered, and gain hands-on experience with **Python scripting, multithreading, and cybersecurity fundamentals** in a controlled Kali Linux environment.

## **Skills Learned**
- Practical experience with **network scanning and port enumeration**  
- Understanding of **common services and protocols** running on open ports  
- Experience in **multithreading** for efficient scanning  
- **Python scripting** for developing security tools  
- Understanding the role of **reconnaissance** in penetration testing workflows  

## **Packages Used**
- **socket** – for network communication and port checking  
- **threading** – for concurrent scanning to improve speed  
- **sys** – for command-line argument handling  
- **time** – for scan timing and delays  

## **Steps**
Below are the key steps taken in using the Python Port Scanner:

**Ref 2: Netcat Listener Test**  
This screenshot demonstrates opening ports using Netcat (`nc -lk -p <port>`) to test the scanner against a live listener.
